Welcome to the SWIFT PIPELINE for the simulation of different Dark Matter Halo profiles (NFW/King/Einasto/Hernquist). {NFWX is a WIP}

Prerequisites:
- Run this pipeline on a Linux PC.
- Install the SWIFT software. (https://swift.dur.ac.uk/docs/index.html)

How to run:
- Open a terminal;
- Use the change mode command for the swift_pipe.sh file with: 
'chmod 777 swift_pipe' 

- Run the simulation software with:
'./swift_pipe.sh [INSERT PROFILE] [NUMBER OF PARTICLES] [PLOTTING]'

Where:
[INSERT PROFILE]        ∈ {NFW,King,Einasto,Hernquist}
[NUMBER OF PARTICLES]   ∈ ℕ
[PLOTTING]              ∈ {T,F}

When [PLOTTING] = T | After the simulation runs the output snapshots are used to plot information on the evolution of the profile over the snapshots.
You can specify for each of the options below if you want the plot these by entering (y) in the terminal when prompted the plotting question.

The plot options are:
-    Angular momentum over time; Fractional change in angular momentum in each axis.
-    A GIF of the Density profiles and the mass vs. radius.
-    A GIF of the Spatial distribution including the Overdensity radii and Density profiles with the bound percentages. Also, it plots the Kinetic & Potential energies and the number of particles over the simulation run.
